--> My name is Heejae (Jae) Roh.

I'm a rising senior at Northeastern University studying Data Analytics. I was an Analysis report writer in the National Assembly of Republic of the Korea. I love to study how to interact and relate to others and make the best performance. When I meet people, I look at their strengths and apply what I can learn to my life.
